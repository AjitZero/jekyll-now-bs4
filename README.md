# Jekyll Now with Bootstrap 4

> [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) is a forkable starter template for creating a Jekyll blog by [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark).
> 
> This project is a clone of `barryclark/jekyll-now` from [this commit](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/tree/12cb8a2e97c3b63c4bc92d2a1ab050b35bf946b7).

In addition to the original features, this version includes some more features which I needed in multiple projects.

## Features

- [Bootstrap]([https://getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/)) `4.3.1` layout.
- Included `/_data`, currently used for navigation only.
- Support for `/category` and `/authors` pages.
- Added plugins:
  - `jekyll-paginate`: Pagination.
  - `jekyll-avatar`: Support for GitHub Avatars.
  - `jekyll-mentions`: Support for mentions, defaulting to Twitter.
- **Removed** Disqus related code.
