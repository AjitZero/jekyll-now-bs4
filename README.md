# Jekyll Now with Bootstrap 4

In addition to the original features, this version includes some more features which I needed in multiple projects. Bootstrap is just handy.

## Features

- Uses [Bootstrap]([https://getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/)) `4.3.1` layout.
- Supports **categories** as a [collection](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/):
  - Each category gets a `/category/:name` page with meta-data
  - `/category` lists all categories, along with all articles under them so far.
- Supports **authors** as a collection:
  - Each author gets a `/authors/:name` page with social links and bio.
  - `/authors` lists all authors. For now.
- Includes `/_data`, currently used for navigation only.
  > This one isn't a "necessary" addition but allows for much freedom in the long run.
  >
  > Or so I think ðŸ™Œ
- Added plugins:
  - `jekyll-paginate`: Pagination.
  - `jekyll-mentions`: Support for mentions, defaulting to Twitter.
  - `jekyll-avatar`: Support for GitHub Avatars.
    - Supports using chosen images as well.
    - â€¦ which falls back to GitHub Avatar...
    - â€¦ which falls back to a placeholder avatar with the first letter of the first name.

------

- **Removed** Disqus related code.

  > This part can be easily restored from [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). I don't ever use it though.
